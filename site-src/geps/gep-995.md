# GEP-995: HTTP Route Naming

* Issue: [#995](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/995)
* Status: Implementable

## TLDR

* Add `Name` field to `Rules` field in HTTPRoute.
* Add `Name` field to `Matches` field in HTTPRouteRule.

## Goals

Provide a path for implementations to support:

* Policy Attachment:
  Attach policies to HTTP route.
* Route Attachment/Delegation:
  Ability to have more fine-grained matches for policy references
  if we add sectionName to the policy object.
* Improved Debugging: 
  Ability to add debugging information, such as adding the specific matching route rule name to an access log.

## Non-Goals

* Define how implementations should support these features.

## Introduction

As described above, there are a number of potential use cases for providing an identity to a route rule.
The most straightforward reason for this is to allow extending a particular HTTP route.
This change will enable implementations to support the above use cases while still providing a portable core.

## API

A `Name` field would be added to `HTTPRouteMatch`:

```go
type HTTPRouteRule struct {
    // The name assigned to the route for debugging purposes. The
    // route's name will be concatenated with the match's name and may
    // be logged in the access logs for requests matching this
    // route/match depends on the implementor.
    //
    // +optional
    Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
    ...
}
```


A `Name` field would be added to `HTTPRouteRule `:

```go
type HTTPRouteMatch struct {
    // Name specifies the HTTP route match name. The match's name will be
    // concatenated with the parent route's name and may be logged in
    // the access logs for requests matching this route depends on the implementor.
    //
    // +optional
    Name *string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	...
}
```
